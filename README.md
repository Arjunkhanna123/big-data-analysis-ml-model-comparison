# Big Data Analysis – ML Model Comparison

## Overview
This project focuses on performing data analysis and implementing multiple machine learning models to compare their performance on the same dataset. The experiments were conducted using Google Colab.

## Models Implemented
- Model 1
- Model 2
- Model 3
- Model 4

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Workflow
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction and preparation
- Training multiple ML models
- Model evaluation and comparison using metrics

## Note
This project was developed as part of an academic big data analysis exercise.
